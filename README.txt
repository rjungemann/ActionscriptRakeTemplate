== DESCRIPTION:

The simplest possible Flex Builder-compatible Rake project for ActionScript projects. Use this to edit your projects in your editor of choice, and then build them from the command line. That way you never have to use Flex Builder unless you choose to.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Only currently works on OS X.

== SYNOPSIS:

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Mac OS X, for now
* A valid Ruby installation
* A valid Flash or Flex installation

== INSTALL:

* Make sure you have a valid Ruby installation. If you're running OS X.5 or greater, you already do.
* Make sure you have either Flex Builder or a valid Flex SDK.
* Check out this project from Github.
* Edit the Rakefile to change the path to your valid Flex SDK.
* Edit the Rakefile with your project name. Edit the "bin/index.html" and change the "var so" line to reflect your project name.
* Run Rake by typing in "rake" from a Terminal set to the "ActionscriptRakeTemplate directory".
* You can see a list of tasks by typing in "rake -T".
